# About Me
<p align="left">
  I have familiarized myself with the programming languages such as C, C++ and Python. I have also expanded my knowledge in MATLAB, Microsoft Power point and My SQL. In addition to this I have participated in KIIT International MUN to hone my communication and public speaking skills. I am also quite skilled at Data Structures, Algorithms and Web content writing. I enjoy HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery.

I intent to further develop my skills and to take a specialization course, and most importantly I never intend to stop growing.</p>
